Category,Finding,Implication
Data Quality,"All features complete, no missing values",No data cleaning needed - ready for ML
Feature Distribution,Most features show normal/near-normal distribution,No transformation needed for most algorithms
Correlation,No high correlation between features (all < 0.5),All features are independent - no multicollinearity
Crop Balance,Perfect balance: 100 samples per crop,No class imbalance - unbiased model expected
NPK Patterns,Different crops have distinct NPK requirements,NPK can be strong predictors for classification
Climate Zones,4 distinct climate zones identified,Temperature+Rainfall combination is informative
pH Requirements,pH ranges from 3.5 (acidic) to 9.9 (alkaline),pH is discriminative feature for crop selection
Rainfall Patterns,Rainfall ranges from 20.2 to 298.6 mm,Water requirement varies significantly by crop
